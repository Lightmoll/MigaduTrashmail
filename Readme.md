 - very lightweight
 - completely self hosted

## How it works
The e-mail generator will create an alias with the specified name, which will redirect to the specified e-mail inbox in `config.py::SPAM_MAILS`. Then after the spam-alias is not in use, the program will simply delete the alias and all emails send to the old alias will be rejected. However, if at a later point in time the same "fake" e-mail is required a new alias may be created and redirecting continues.

_Note_: Because of migadu limitations you can only create an alias for the same domain. Therefore all emails generated with one domain, will redirect to the correspronding e-mail inbox listed.

## Installation (Testing)

2. (optional) create a new venv
3. install all requirements by `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

5. run application with `python3 server.py`

## Installation (Production)
1. follow steps 1-3 in testing build
2. install `gunicorn3`
3. run the server with `gunicorn server:app -w 2`
    where 2 corresponds with the number of workers spawned for the app
4. configure your reverse proxy to redirect all traffic to port 8000
